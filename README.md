# SQL_Coding

This repository is intended as a development environment for building new workflows within Neotoma that rely heavily on SQL coding.

Code here is primarily for development and will be moved to its own repository as it matures. As such, any code here should be **treated with caution**.

## Current Projects

* [210Pb Template](https://github.com/NeotomaDB/SQL_Project_Repository/tree/main/210Pb_Template) is a repository that supports the development of a bespoke uploader for data into Neotoma. The project is structured as both a data validator and a data uploader.
